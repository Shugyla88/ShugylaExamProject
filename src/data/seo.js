I have always been interested in how digital products interact with users and how this process can be made more convenient and enjoyable. I am convinced that good design can significantly improve the quality of people's lives, and I want to contribute to this area.Why did I choose UI-UX design.My passion for design began in childhood, when I loved to draw and come up with various concepts for fictional websites and applications. Over time, this fascination has grown into a desire to understand exactly how interfaces work and how to make them more intuitive. At the Faculty of Digital Management and Design, I got the opportunity to study the basics of designing and developing digital products, and this further strengthened my desire to become a UI-UX designer.",
